A. Legs

It's another beautiful day on Farmer John's farm.

After Farmer John arrived at his farm, he counted n
 legs. It is known only chickens and cows live on the farm, and a chicken has 2
 legs while a cow has 4
.
What is the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm assuming he counted the legs of all animals?

Input
The first line contains single integer t
 (1≤t≤103
) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains an integer n
 (2≤n≤2⋅103
, n
 is even).

Output
For each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm.

C. Sort

You are given two strings a
 and b
 of length n
. Then, you are (forced against your will) to answer q
 queries.

For each query, you are given a range bounded by l
 and r
. In one operation, you can choose an integer i
 (l≤i≤r
) and set ai=x
 where x
 is any character you desire. Output the minimum number of operations you must perform such that sorted(a[l..r])=sorted(b[l..r])
. The operations you perform on one query does not affect other queries.

For an arbitrary string c
, sorted(c[l..r])
 denotes the substring consisting of characters cl,cl+1,...,cr
 sorted in lexicographical order.

Input
The first line contains t
 (1≤t≤1000
) – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and q
 (1≤n,q≤2⋅105
) – the length of both strings and the number of queries.

The following line contains a
 of length n
. It is guaranteed a
 only contains lowercase latin letters.

The following line contains b
 of length n
. It is guaranteed b
 only contains lowercase latin letters.

The following q
 lines contain two integers l
 and r
 (1≤l≤r≤n
) – the range of the query.

It is guaranteed the sum of n
 and q
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each query, output an integer, the minimum number of operations you need to perform in a new line.
